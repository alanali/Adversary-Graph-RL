# Decision Modeling Using Reinforcement Learning
Employs graph theory to model adversary moves within a strategic environment. 

The algorithm takes into account rewards, risks, and different consequences to those risks associated with each move in the graph and chooses the most optimal path based on different reinforcement learning algorithms, primarily Q-Learning.
